# What is an "uber-user" and what are we doing with them? #

Uber User = "real user" but we've hand selected the tech savvy ones ;)

On Tuesday Feb 10th, developers and real users will get together in small groups face-to-face to have a day of brainstorming and paper prototyping.  There will be 5 rooms with two "uber users" in each room (representing a spectrum of higher education use).

# Why do we need to know what users think? #

We are hoping that this day will help focus developers competing in the DeveloperDecathlon  on real app problems for users in higher education.  Though, we would encourage any developers who already have their use cases to get on with their decathlon entries: we have an open room (or rather bar = CampBase ) for those who wish to get hacking.
