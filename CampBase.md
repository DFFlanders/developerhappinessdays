# Camp Base = Open Networking #

The open networking room (aka "Camp Base") is a place for people to come and have the 'water-cooler conversation', no schedules, no agenda, just you a cup of coffee and a chat with a fellow developer (after all, isn't this why we come to these events?).

We'll also have work areas set-up for teams to work on their developer decathalon prototypes.  We are trying to encourage pair-programming where possible.  Feel free to stop by and check out the prototypes-in-progress and maybe even offer your nimble coding skillz for bits of work (don't forget to pay any help via your dev8D tokens).

The Camp Base will be in the following rooms each day:
  * Monday (9th) Room B04
  * Tuesday (10th) George Birkbeck Bar on 4th Floor
  * Wednesday (11th) Room B02/3 & B04
  * Thursday (12th) Lecture Theatre B35
  * Friday (13th) George Birkbeck Bar on 4th Floor
