#summary Everything I'd been meaning to get around to ask about regular expressions.
#labels Tuesday

= Introduction =

Regular expressions are a handy tool in a programmers repertoire. This talk is split into two halves, you can attend either or both.

= Details =

The first half will be the utter basics to get you started. I'll cover: . ? $ ^ * []

The second half will go into some more detail about more advanced techniques. 

To support both talks I've produced a web-based play-pen for trying out the examples.

I'm assuming the most people will have lappys and wifi, so you can try out variations on the examples as we go.
