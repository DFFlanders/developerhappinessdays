#summary Everything I'd been meaning to get around to ask about regular expressions.
#labels Tuesday

= Introduction =

Regular expressions are a handy tool in a programmers repertoire. This talk is split into two halves, you can attend either or both.

= Details =

== The basics (part 1) ==
The first half will be the utter basics to get you started. I'll cover: . ? $ ^ * []

== Some cool regexp stuff (part 2) ==

The second half will go into some more detail about more advanced techniques. 

To support both talks I've produced a web-based play-pen for trying out the examples.

I'm assuming the most people will have lappys and wifi, so you can try out variations on the examples as we go.

This is intended for people who know little or nothing about regexps, not a master-class. By the end of it you'll be able to make use of them, but there's a whole bunch more I'll not have time to cover. I've picked a useful subset.
