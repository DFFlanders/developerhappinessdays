#summary open networking room and camp base for developer teams working on developer decathlon prototypes
#labels Wednesday,Thursday

= Camp Base = Open Networking =

The open networking room (aka "Camp Base") is a place for people to come and have the 'water-cooler conversation', no schedules, no agenda, just you a cup of coffee and a chat with a fellow developer (after all, isn't this why we come to these events?).

We'll also have work areas set-up for teams to work on their developer decathalon prototypes.  We are trying to encourage pair-programming where possible.  Feel free to stop by and check out the prototypes-in-progress and maybe even offer your nimble coding skillz for bits of work (don't forget to pay any help via your dev8D tokens).

The Camp Base will be in the following rooms each day:
  * Monday (9th) Room B04
  * Tuesday (10th) George Birkbeck Bar on 4th Floor
  * Wednesday (11th) Room B04
  * Thursday (12th) Lecture Theatre B35
  * Friday (13th) George Birkbeck Bar on 4th Floor

For those who set up shop in Base Camp if you could add the name of your team to the wiki along with a short description of the prototype you are working on?  This is so others can come and offer their services and have a look over your shoulder (and maybe even offer some quick advice).

Please feel free to include any or all of the following:
  * Name of team
  * Members in your team
  * Place in room where you are located
  * Name of prototype working on
  * Description of prototype
  * Problem this prototype addresses for the user.
  * Tech you are working with to build it
  * Interesting tidbit of info, etc.
