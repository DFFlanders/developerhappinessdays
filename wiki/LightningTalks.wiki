#summary Sign up here to give a 5-15 minutes pitch on something you think worthwhile for dev use

= Introduction =

Lightning talks will take place after lunch on Tuesday (10th) and all day Wednesday (11th).  If you would like to give a talk please sign up below.  We'll have a data projector and whiteboard on hand for any visual aids, though you only need to bring your enthusiasm and voice (or anyone who can pitch a framework with only actions is a rockstar in my book).

= Sign-up Here =

If you are interested in giving a lightning talk please put your name below along with how long you'll need (we'll also provide 5 minutes for Q&A).
