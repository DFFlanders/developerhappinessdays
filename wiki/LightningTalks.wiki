#summary detailed schedule for talks being given to help DeveloperDecathlon prototypes
#labels Tuesday,Wednesday

= Two days of LightningTalks for the DeveloperDecathlon =

*What is a lightning talk?* = "lightning" refers to two things: a.) eye opening, as in a "lightning bolt to the brain", and b.) ideas that are quick and to the point.
  * We'll have flipcharts, whiteboards and a projector on hand for any visual aids, though you only need to bring your brightest ideas! 8D

===We hope the LightningTalks will inspire you to innovate a prototype for the DeveloperDecathlon !===
   

== Tuesday Morning (10th) ==
*10am-11am Morning ice-breaker presentations*: We've scheduled the first presentation for the morning session, after that you'll be expected to get up and engage the group with your own ideas <--see EventEtiquette.
