= Catching the long tail of research data =

The premise of my proposal is that large amounts of research data, gathered by researchers in small groups, are lost when the original research has been completed and the papers have been published.  This despite there being significant investment in building up suitable repositories for collecting, preserving and publishing data.  It seems that good progress is being made to preserve and disseminate data from larger-scale projects with access to IT development capacity, but that vast amounts of painstakingly-collected data from small groups is slipping through the net.

I posit that part of the reason for this is much data is gathered by small research groups without the expertise or capacity to build IT systems to share and organize their data, and for such groups the activation energy required to use VRE-type systems is too high for the benefit to their primary research.

Thus, I would like to explore, as a "paper prototype", the presented form of a system the aims to capture, in as lightweight fashion as possible, research data generated by small research teams, initially on their own personal computers, and help to organize and annotate the data sufficiently for subsequent preservation and publication.  The prototyping stage should not assume any particular supporting technology or platform (other than using the web), but rather focus on the user interactions.  I'm particularly interested in getting ideas about user interactions that can be used to capture information about the research data without imposing barriers to the researchers' main interest.

Helen leads a small research group conducting research into genetic function in Drosophila (fruit fly).  She is a University lecturer and is PI on a couple of BBSRC-funded research projects.  Helen uses a Macintosh desktop, and her most frequently used applications are a web browser to access bioinformatic databases, Excel to analyze data, word and powerpoint to prepare papers and presentations.  Helen also maintains collaborations with Drosphila researchers in other universities, exchanging biomaterial samples, data, images and ideas.

Liz is a post-doc working for Helen, leads much of the day-to-day research activity for the main research project running in Helen's lab, and collaborates with Helen in authoring papers.  Liz' computer is a PC, and uses the same applications as Helen. Liz also particpates in external collaborations.

Lynne is a research associate who undertakes much of the research data acquisition and annotation, and other research group activities.

The research involves a moderately complex workflow involving biological assays (microarray, PCR), statistical data analysis for sample selection, sample preparation (dissection and preparation of slides for microscopy, capture of microscopic images using a PC-connected high-quality video camera attached to a microscope.  The lab containing the microscope, camera and image-capture PC is two levels above the research group's main work area.  In the first instance, images are captured locally and annotations are captured in a notebook.  The annotations are later transferred to a spreadsheet for further analysis.

The amount of research effort that does into the observation and data capture of =each sample is very significant.  This is no high-volume automated data acquisition facility, so almost every byte is valuable.  Over the course of a three year project with three researchers (2 people FTE?), the about 6000 samples are imaged and annotated.  A back-of-envelope calculation suggests an acquisition cost of about Â£20,000/sample (assuming 200K pppa including lab and equipment costs.)

The resulting images are meaningless without associated metadata about at least the strain of organism and identification gene whose expression is images.  Significant information that would be very difficult to reconstruct post-hoc is annotation of the biological regions within which the gene is expressed.

In  summary, the picture here is of modest data volumes of fairly complex information with very high per-sample or per-image collection costs.
