 #summary Catching the long tail of research data

= Catching the long tail of research data =

The premise of my proposal is that large amounts of research data, gathered by researchers in small groups, are lost when the original research has been completed and the papers have been published.  This despite there being significant investment in building up suitable repositories for collecting, preserving and publishing data.  It seems that good progress is being made to preserve and disseminate data from larger-scale projects, but that vast amounts of painstakingly-collected data from small groups is slipping through the net.

I posit that part of the reason for this is much data is gathered by small research groups without the expertise or capacity to build IT systems to share and organize their data, and for such groups the activation energy required to use VRE-type systems is too high for the benefit to their primary research.

Thus, I would like to explore, as a "paper prototype", the presented form of a system the aims to capture, in as lightweight fashion as possible, research data generated by small research teams, initially on their own personal computers, and help to organize and annotate the data sufficiently for subsequent preservation and publication.
