= Catching the long tail of research data =

The premise of my proposal is that large amounts of research data, gathered by researchers in small groups, are lost when the original research has been completed and the papers have been published.  This despite there being significant investment in building up suitable repositories for collecting, preserving and publishing data.  It seems that good progress is being made to preserve and disseminate data from larger-scale projects with access to IT development capacity, but that vast amounts of painstakingly-collected data from small groups is slipping through the net.

I posit that part of the reason for this is much data is gathered by small research groups without the expertise or capacity to build IT systems to share and organize their data, and for such groups the activation energy required to use VRE-type systems is too high for the benefit to their primary research.

Thus, I would like to explore, as a "paper prototype", the presented form of a system the aims to capture, in as lightweight fashion as possible, research data generated by small research teams, initially on their own personal computers, and help to organize and annotate the data sufficiently for subsequent preservation and publication.  The prototyping stage should not assume any particular supporting technology or platform (other than using the web), but rather focus on the user interactions.  I'm particularly interested in getting ideas about user interactions that can be used to capture information about the research data without imposing barriers to the researchers' main interest.

Having noted that the interactions should not be based on existing systems, my hope is that a suitable solution can be assembled substantially from available software.

For an example of what might be required, think of a "Flickr for researchers".


= Sketch of prototypical user =

_This sketch is based on real researchers with whom we have worked, is intended as an illustration rather than a constraining specification, and does not purport to present an accurate description of any real person.  Nothing here should be taken as limiting the kind of research data of supporting functions that might be provided._

Helen leads a small research group conducting research into genetic function in Drosophila (fruit fly).  She is a University lecturer and is PI on a couple of BBSRC-funded research projects.  Helen uses a Macintosh desktop, and her most frequently used applications are a web browser to access bioinformatic databases, Excel to analyze data, word and powerpoint to prepare papers and presentations.  Helen also maintains collaborations with Drosphila researchers in other universities, exchanging biomaterial samples, data, images and ideas.

Liz is a post-doc working for Helen, leads much of the day-to-day research activity for the main research project running in Helen's lab, and collaborates with Helen in authoring papers.  Liz' computer is a PC, and uses the same applications as Helen. Liz also particpates in external collaborations.

Lynne is a research associate who undertakes much of the research data acquisition and annotation, and other research group activities.

The research involves a moderately complex workflow involving biological assays (microarray, PCR), statistical data analysis for sample selection, sample preparation (dissection and preparation of slides for microscopy, capture of microscopic images using a PC-connected high-quality video camera attached to a microscope.  The lab containing the microscope, camera and image-capture PC is two levels above the research group's main work area.  In the first instance, images are captured locally and annotations are captured in a notebook.  The annotations are later transferred to a spreadsheet for further analysis.

The amount of research effort that does into the observation and data capture of =each sample is very significant.  This is no high-volume automated data acquisition facility, so almost every byte is valuable.  Over the course of a three year project with three researchers (2 people FTE?), the about 6000 samples are imaged and annotated.  A back-of-envelope calculation suggests an acquisition cost of about Â£20,000/sample (assuming 200K pppa including lab and equipment costs.)

The resulting images are meaningless without associated metadata about at least the strain of organism and identification gene whose expression is images.  Significant information that would be very difficult to reconstruct post-hoc is annotation of the biological regions within which the gene is expressed.

In  summary, the picture here is of modest data volumes of fairly complex information with very high per-sample or per-image collection costs.


= High-level problem statement =

Despite investment in repositories and supporting systems, much of the data produced by small research groups is lost to further use when the original research project is completed.

By "small reseerch group", I mean groups with maybe 2-6 people with to access to IT expertise or capacity top develop or deploy specialist systems to support their research.

= Second-level problems =

_Of course, any of these statements about "existing systems" may be refuted by existence proof_

 * Existing research environment systems are too complex or difficult to use or set up for our users.  The effort required is not, in their perception, justified by the benefits.
 * Existing data sharing systems don't provide easy access to the required capabilities (e.g. associate spreadsheet data with images)
 * Existing systems don't provide access to the structure inherrent in the data (e.g. search for images of expression of a specified gene indicated by a spreadsheet column).
 * To (usefully) enable preservation and publication of data, some degree of descriptive metadata (administrative and domain-related; e.g. researcher name, sample strain).  It is assumed that most of the required metadata is available somewhere in the data.

= User stories =

The template format used here (As a ... I want ... so that ...) helps to ensure these requirements are related to *user* requiremewnts rather than (questionable) technical requirements.

The stories here are my best estimate of requirements of users I have worked with, but they have not (yet) been fully validated with these users.  As such, I am trying to e a proxy for the researcher here, which is less-than-ideal.

== Sharing between collaborators ==

As a: small research group

We want: to be able easily to share data with local and remote collaborators without immediately making it publicly accessible

So that:
 * we can pool insights, analysis and data to improve research results
 * we can capture data on one computer and analyze them on another

== Safety of data ==

As a: small research group

We want: captured data to be safe from loss caused by system failure or unexpected events

So that:  (obvious!)

== Submission to repository ==

As a: small research group

We want: to easily submit data to an institutional repsotory

So that: our personal, institutional and research council investment is preserved for possible future use.

Note: simply preserving raw data is not enough; a repository will require some administrative metadata to be created, and accessibilitty of the preserved data will be improved if it can be keyed on relevant research pareameters (gene id, etc.)

== Publication of data ==

As a: small research group

We want: to easily make our data available for public access

So that:
 * we can gain personal kudos when our work is re-used and acknowledged by other researchers (and maybe, in future, real RAE-style status enhancement).
 * to satisfy the requirements of some research funding agencies
 * our research can contribute more effectively the a general public good, through re-use and secondary research

Note: it will often be a requirement that publication of data is embargoed until papers have been published and/or local programmes of data anlysis have run their course.

Note: simply preserving raw data is not enough; a repository will require some administrative metadata to be created, and accessibilitty of the preserved data will be improved if it can be keyed on relevant research pareameters (gene id, etc.)

== Updating data ==

As a: small group researcher

I want: to be able to update (change, replace) data that I have shared with collaborators

So that: I can share early results for discussion with colleagues, and for safety, without these tentative data becoming part of the eventually preserved and/or published

== Use commonly available tools ==

As a: small group researcher

I want: to have access to the various benefits of data management without installing new software on the computer being used

So that:
 * I do not have to be bothered with installing and configuring new software
 * I can access my data from any suitably-connected computer (e.g. for discussion with colleagues at a conference)


== Selective preservation/publication ?? ==

...

== Recover older versions of shared data ?? ==
