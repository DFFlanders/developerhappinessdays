#summary for those who have not been to a barcamp or unconference this page explains some basic guidelines for participating at dev8D

= "more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules" =

As dev8D is one of these non-traditional types of events, where the emphasis is placed upon the participants to lead, we wanted to establish an event etiquette (which is more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules).

If you've been to an unconference or bacamp before then you'll know what to expect; or rather, you'll know _not_ to expect anything as each event is its own 'unique snowflake' <-- keep in mind these types of events were invented in the 70's 8D .  Nonetheless, here are some guidelines that can help create those moments where a small group of you are meeting to talk about the things your geek-inner-ego is really passiontae about:

  # "the rule of two feet" - Any person neither learning from nor contributing to a group discussion must use their feet (or other) to move to someplace where they are participating (aka "law of mobility")
  # "wherever two or more are gathered there be holy ground" - perhaps a bit zealous, but don't take for granted the 'water cooler conversations' and by all means please don't waste too much time talking about the weather.  We'll have flipcharts placed all around the venue and you are encouraged to use these as conversation nodes where you can write down a couple words or sketeches that will show others what you are having a conversation about.
  # JOIN IN!, don't be exclusive when someone joins a conversation, open up your circle to let them in and acknowledge them (usually by a head bob) that they are there.
  # Generally people tend to adopt one of four roles at these events (though most will transition between each one throughout the event): 
    * a.) "scribes" are those getting stuff up on flipcharts, the wiki and posting tagged content (tweets, blogs, vlogs, etc), 
    * b.) "lurkers" are those standing back and just actively listening, these people often become a backchannel scribe (event organisers like these people and their in depth commentary!); 
    * c.) "soap-boxers" are those selling their ideas to groups -for good or bad- so long as they are passionate, and
    * d.) "butterflys"  are those continually moving from group to group absorbing the overall ebbs and tides of the event. 
  # "You are not a leming, don't act like one!" - Attend scheduled taught events (i.e. the LightningTalks) only if you really want to, otherwise *your primary objective at dev8D is to have small group conversations* _(and ideally to the point where you are creating a prototype for the developerDecathlon competition_).
