Some maps to reference so you don't get lost in Bloomsbury:
  * [Map of venues that dev8D will be taking place](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&t=h&msa=0&msid=109443678151918765851.000455c196a5b4e7be955&ll=51.522937,-0.129186&spn=0.003645,0.006909&z=17).
  * [Map of hotels in the local area](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=hotel&sll=51.522937,-0.131224&sspn=0.003645,0.010986&ie=UTF8&ll=51.523017,-0.129197&spn=0.006983,0.021973&t=h&z=16)
    * The easiest way to book a hotel is go to lastminute.com and search for hotels in central London and then sort your search results to list hotels near the 'British Library' or 'British Museum' which will put you within walking distance of Birkbeck.
    * Thus far it sounds as if many are staying at the [Russel Hotell](http://www.londonrussellhotel.co.uk/) in Bloomsbury.

# Schedule of Events: #
Below is the schedule of events that will be taking place at dev8D.  The general style of dev8D is that of a [barcamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp) or an [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference), both of which encourage participants to help lead the event (see the EventEtiquette wiki page if you've not been to an event like this before).  Happiness is usually achieved at these event in small group collaborations (rather than a single person powerpointing to a group); though we have tried to provide both open networking sessions (e.g. CampBase) and taught workshops (e.g. LightningTalks) so everyone's learning needs are met.

You are welcome to attend as many or as few days as you like as it is all free!  _Though_, please make sure that you attend the events you have signed up for as we have bought food for you and would not like to waste any of it. 8D

The first half of the day will consist of ten UberUsers on hand (students, teachers & researchers) to work with you in figuring out what the next innovative step in Academia we should be taking!  Based on these talk shops, developers should begin to form paper prototype solutions.
    * 12.30-14.30: LUNCH will be served in George Birkbeck Bar on the 4th Floor
      * So as not to break up any good group work, lunch will be served for two hours: please feel free to come down from the 6th floor rooms to grab some food and get back to working in your small groups.
    * 2pm-3pm: repeat of ice breaker LightningTalks from the morning.
    * 3-5pm: Team paper prototype planning in 6th Floor Rooms (you should be finalising your paper prototypes and perhaps even getting stated on the mark-ups).
      * This second half of the day will be spent finalising paper prototypes and breaking up into smaller groups: flipcharts, brainstorming and talk-shops will take place throughout the afternoon.  The UberUsers will be on hand to answer any questions about your paper prototype designs.
    * 5pm-onwards: George Birkbeck bar will be open for anyone wishing to stay on and have further discussions.
  * **Why:** While the emphasis is spreading knowledge of developer goodness there are some prizes up for grabs including the [Developer Decathlon prize](http://code.google.com/p/developerhappinessdays/wiki/Prizes_at_dev8D) and the [Individual Medly prize](http://code.google.com/p/developerhappinessdays/wiki/Prizes_at_dev8D).

During the day we will also have a CampBase for open networking and those competing to get on with the hacking of their DeveloperDecathlon prototypes (due one week after today).  This day is also for individual medley competitors to go around and provide support, pair-programming and other useful tips/hints so they can earn more tokens.  Caffeine and food will be on hand throughout the day to fuel the frenzy.

# Evening Wed 11 Feb: Bowl Camp #
  * **Where:** [Entrance to King Pin VIP Bowling Lounge map](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&t=h&msa=0&msid=109443678151918765851.000455c196a5b4e7be955&ll=51.524025,-0.128515&spn=0.001822,0.003455&z=18).  Make sure you take the **gold** stairs to the King Pin Lounge and NOT the ramp to the Bloomsbury Bowling Lanes.
  * **When:** Wednesday evening from 7pm to 11pm.
  * **What:** Pretty simple: bowling, video games, food and talking shop over beers with your fellow developers.  These VIP bowling lanes usually host kick-off events for music videos (i.e. you don't want to miss this place). We'll also be announcing the winner of the individual medley so bring all your tokens if you think you have a chance at the prizes!
  * **Why:** We think the secret sauce to interoperability is developers trusting other developers. We also just like developers and think they deserve a big _Thank You_ for all the hard work they do!
